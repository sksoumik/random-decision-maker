App maker



Let's build a Next.js app using React and TypeScript for desktop and mobile browsers. Before writing any code, check the current versions of Node, npm, and npx on my system, along with anything else required to get started. If any of them need updating, do that first. Make sure all the code you write is compatible with my current setup.
I'm using macOS on an Apple Silicon machine. I am already in the folder which I created for this app, so use this as the project directory.
When writing the code, make sure you're aligned with what I've already built or asked for. If something is missing that’s essential for the app to work properly or deliver a great user experience, point it out. If anything is unclear, ask me before continuing, even if I haven’t specifically told you to.
Error handling should be strong. The app needs to be fault-tolerant and resilient. It should never crash in production. 
Use async operations and caching wherever it makes sense to keep the app fast and responsive.
While writing code, use the industry best practices like a 20 years of experienced software engineer. Write modular, fault-tolerant, readable codes.  
When working on the UI, keep things simple and intuitive. The design should be mobile-friendly so users can access it easily from both desktop and mobile browsers. 
Use a consistent layout, color scheme, and typography to make the app feel trustworthy and easy to use. Prioritize responsiveness, fast load times, and accessibility so it works well for everyone.

This app will be live for public use and I plan to show ads on it later. So follow all best practices for performance, SEO, and Google Ads compatibility. 
Optimize the code for speed and efficiency so it performs well in production.
Also, add everything needed to help the site rank on the first page of Google search results, ideally the top spot.

Now here’s the app idea. I want to launch a company portfolio site at neuralix.app. That’s the base domain. I’ll be publishing various web apps under subdomains like decisionmaker.neuralix.app, somethingelse.neuralix.app, and so on.
What I need you to build right now is the main company portfolio at the base domain. This site should include all the usual sections you’d find in a company portfolio site. It also needs a separate section where we list all the products we’ve made.
Each product listing should include an image, title, short description, and a link that redirects to the actual app. For now, just use a few demo products as placeholders.
The app should be built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.
The app should be responsive and mobile-friendly.
The app should be SEO-friendly.
The app should be fast and efficient.
The app should be secure and reliable.
The app should be easy to maintain and update.

## IMPORTANT: The main features it must have
1. A beautiful decision wheel with a beautiful UI and UX. Which should rotate when there are at least 2 options. If the there less than 2 options, it should show a message to the user to add more options.
2. It should have "Clear All" button which should clear all the options and reset the wheel.
3. It should have "Add Option" button which should add a new option to the wheel.
4. It should have "Remove Option" button which should remove the last option from the wheel.
5. It should have "Shuffle" button which should shuffle the options.
6. It should have "History" button which should show the history of the recent decisions.
7. It should have all the required pages like Home, About, Contact, etc. and all other pages which are required for a SEO friendly website.
8. It should have compliance with Google Ads and Google Search Console. 
9. The design should be beautiful, modern and responsive.
